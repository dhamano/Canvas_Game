# Intro to Games with Vanilla JS

This is a small project to follow along a tutorial on an intro to JS games.
I took the liberty of not following the tutorial exactly and figuring some things
out for myself.

There are bugs galore but was an interesting introduction. The purpose of doing
this was to stretch myself and to have a better idea of what is going on under-the-hood
before I dipped into gaming libraries.

_The tutorial I followed is here:_
